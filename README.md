# student-checklist-git-pull

# Intro
So boring sit in the class with all genius students. They don't usually asking for my help. I have plenty of time.
My github page seem a little quiet for some time. Here a good time update my repositories.

# Goal
To be able to tell who didn't submit their assignments through out the course

# Instructions
  - git clone $this.repo
  - make a .txt file copying the content from `Pull Requests` on GitHub Fork Repo
  - remember their relative path ( Later use as `argument script` when call the check.js in terminal )
    >> node check.js $PATH.TO.TXT.FILE
  - see the result :)
  
# Stacks
  Vanilla JS, RegEx JS
